Lesson 3 reflections

Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1: When sharing the repository with someone or to backup the data on github server.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2: In order to allow the user to decide when to synchronize the 
repository and working folder to have always a project that functions or 
behaves as expected.

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3: 
- Branches are labels of stream of commmits.
+ Use it to lable main commits or other experimental side ones.
- Clones are copies of remote repositories on a harddrive.
+ Use it to download a repository when you want to work on it on your harddrive and do not want to reference to it.
- forks are clones of repositories with reference to the original github repository.
+ Use it to get a repository, but also to let the author know that you have used it, so other can reference to the author.

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4: 

Q5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5: Either using dropbox, or google drive. When working on the same file, there would be a conflict that contributor would have to resolve, but there is no functionality of merging. IT might be easier in the sense that I would not have to take an entire course ;), but in the long run, Git and Github makes everything more automatic, faster, and safer.

Q6: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A6: When I am testing some new features and experience, so that my master branch does not get broken.
