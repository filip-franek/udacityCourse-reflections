Lesson 3 reflections

Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1: When sharing the repository with someone or to backup the data on github server.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2: In order to allow the user to decide when to synchronize the 
repository and working folder to have always a project that functions or 
behaves as expected.
